Data Assumptions

Each row in orders represents a completed purchase

order_value reflects total revenue for that order

Customers may have multiple orders over time

Funnel events are assumed to be timestamped accurately

Retention is measured at a monthly granularity, aligned with business reporting cycles

Any deviations from these assumptions should be explicitly stated during analysis.
