1. Key Findings
Funnel Drop-off

The largest customer drop-off occurs between add-to-cart and purchase, indicating checkout-level friction rather than lack of product interest.

Earlier funnel drop-offs (view → add-to-cart) are consistent with normal browsing behavior and are less critical from a revenue perspective.

Retention Patterns

Customer activity peaks during the signup month and drops sharply thereafter.

Most customers do not convert into repeat buyers, highlighting weak early retention.

Some cohorts demonstrate relatively stronger retention, suggesting acquisition timing and customer intent influence long-term behavior.

Revenue Concentration

Revenue is highly concentrated, with a small percentage of customers contributing a disproportionate share of total revenue.

Repeat buyers generate significantly more revenue than one-time buyers, reinforcing the importance of retention over pure acquisition.

Customer Segmentation

High-spend, repeat, active customers represent the most valuable segment.

Inactive high-value customers pose a critical churn risk and offer strong win-back potential.

New, active, low-spend customers represent an opportunity for upsell and conversion into repeat buyers.

2. Business Implications

Improving checkout conversion will likely yield the highest immediate revenue impact.

Retention improvements, particularly within the first one to two months, can materially increase customer lifetime value.

Revenue growth is more sensitive to customer retention and engagement than to top-of-funnel traffic alone.

Segmentation enables more efficient allocation of marketing and retention resources.

3. Recommendations

Simplify and optimize the checkout experience to reduce add-to-cart to purchase friction.

Introduce targeted post-purchase engagement (e.g., email nudges, incentives) within the first month after signup.

Prioritize loyalty and retention programs for high-spend repeat customers.

Launch win-back campaigns focused on previously high-value but inactive customers.

Validate proposed changes using controlled experiments (e.g., A/B tests on checkout flow or retention incentives).

4. Limitations & Next Steps
Limitations

Funnel events were derived as proxies due to lack of explicit clickstream data.

Retention was measured using purchase behavior only, excluding non-transactional engagement.

Analysis was conducted at a monthly granularity, which may mask short-term behavioral patterns.

Next Steps

Build churn or repeat-purchase propensity models to prioritize retention efforts.

Estimate customer lifetime value (CLV) to guide long-term marketing investment.

Incorporate more granular behavioral data (e.g., session-level events) if available.
